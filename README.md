# RE6502
RE6502 is an emulator for the 6502 cpu written in rust. The project comes with a very basic virtual machine for testing (it just has simple I/O functionality) as well as some test programs (find these in simple_test_machine/programs). The test programs can be built with the win2c64 (or lin2c64, or mac2c64) assembler which can be found here: https://www.aartbik.com/retro.php. Theoretically any 6502 assembler should work but win2c64 is the one I've been using for testing.

# Building
The emulator doesn't really do anything on it's own but you can build it with the normal `cargo build` or `cargo run` if you run this program it will just do some simple internal tests. There are also unit tests you can run with `cargo test`. To make better use of the emulator you'll need to use it as a component of a larger emulator/vm. Take a look a the Simple Test Machine project to see how to use the RE6502 as a component.
