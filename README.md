# RE6502

RE6502 is an emulator for the 6502 cpu written in rust. The project comes with a very basic virtual machine for testing (it just has simple I/O functionality) as well as some test programs (find these in simple_test_machine/programs). The test programs can be built with the win2c64 (or lin2c64, or mac2c64) assembler which can be found here: https://www.aartbik.com/retro.php. Theoretically any 6502 assembler should work but win2c64 is the one I've been using for testing.
